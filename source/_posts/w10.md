## Normal Random Variable
![normal](https://sciencer.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/normal-paranormal-distribution-white.png)
* X is a normal random variable with E(X)= $\mu \in \mathcal{R}$  and Var(X)= $\sigma^2 >0$ 
$$ X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$
* pdf f(x), cdf F(X)
*  
$$ X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \Rightarrow \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0,1).$$ A N(0,1) random variable, i.e. a normal random variable with mean zero and variance 1, is commonly called a *standard normal* and denoted by Z
* pdf and cdf of Z ~ N(0,1). Their definitions and properties
	* pdf 
$$ \phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi }} e^{- x^2/2} $$
	* cdf
$$ \Phi(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x \phi(t) dt.$$
	* Properties
