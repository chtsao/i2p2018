### Class Outline
Compare and Contrast with discrete random variable
* From Discrete Uniform DU(K) to Uniform, U(0,1)
* pmf vs pdf
* Relation between the distribution function F(x) and pdf f(x) of a continous random variable
    $$F′(x)=f(x).$$
* pdf is not a probability but a funciton/tool for computing probability. Specifically,
$$f(x)\neq P(X=x)$$
and
$$P(a≤X≤b)=\int_a^bf(x)\ dx.$$
* Uniform U(0,1)
* Exponential random variable $Exp(\lambda)$
* Normal random variable $N(\mu, \sigma^2).$ (if time permits)
