### Profiling a random variable
 E(X) 與 Var(X) 可以理解為一個隨機變數的快照：E(X) 大致描述X的中央趨勢 (central tendency)而 Var(X) 則反映 X 的分散程度。更進一步
**Chebyshev's Inequality**
Let X be a random variable with mean \\( E(X)= \mu, Var(X)=\sigma^2 \\). Then for any c >0,
$$ P(|X-\mu| \geq c) \leq \frac{Var(X)}{c^2}.$$
ref: Textbook: 13.2, page 183

**Remark**

* Chebyshev's bound is universal, i.e. for any random variable with finite mean and variance. Therefore, it may not be sharp for some random variables. Besides, it does not work well when c is small. 
* Example: Let X be \\( N(\mu, \sigma^2)\\) and take \\( c=\sigma/2, \sigma, 2 \sigma \\). Compute 
$$ P(|X-\mu| \geq c) $$
and compare with the Chebyshev's bound. 

### Probability Integral formula
Let X be a random variable with cdf F. Then \\( F(X) \sim U(0,1). \\)
Hint of proof. You may start by assuming F has a inverse funciton \\( F_{-1}\\) to get some ideas about what's going on. However, PIF holds without this assumption.
